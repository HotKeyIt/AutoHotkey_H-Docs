<h1>Loop (files &amp; folders)</h1>

<p>Retrieves the specified files or folders, one at a time.</p>

<pre class="Syntax">Loop, Files, FilePattern [, Mode]
LoopFiles(FilePattern [, Mode])</pre>
<h3>Parameters</h3>
<dl>

  <dt>Files</dt>
  <dd><p>The literal word <code>Files</code> (case-insensitive). This cannot be a variable or expression.</p></dd>

  <dt>FilePattern</dt>
  <dd><p>The name of a single file or folder, or a wildcard pattern such as C:\Temp\*.tmp. <em>FilePattern</em> is assumed to be in <a href="../Variables.htm#WorkingDir">%A_WorkingDir%</a> if an absolute path isn't specified.</p>
    <p>Both asterisks and question marks are supported as wildcards. A match occurs when the pattern appears in either the file's long/normal name or its <a href="#LoopFileShortName">8.3 short name</a>.</p>
    <p>If this parameter is a single file or folder (i.e. no wildcards) and <em>Recurse</em> is set to 1 or <em>Mode</em> includes <code>R</code>, more than one match will be found if the specified file name appears in more than one of the folders being searched.</p></dd>

  <dt>Mode</dt>
  <dd><p>Zero or more of the following letters:</p>
    <p><code>D</code>: Include directories (folders).<br>
    <code>F</code>: Include files. If both F and D are omitted, files are included but not folders.<br>
    <code>R</code>: Recurse into subdirectories (subfolders). All subfolders will be recursed into, not just those whose names match <em>FilePattern</em>. If R is omitted, files and folders in subfolders are not included.</p>
  </dd>
  
</dl>

<h3>Special Variables Available Inside a File-Loop</h3>
<p>The following variables exist within any file-loop. If an inner file-loop is enclosed by an outer file-loop, the innermost loop's file will take precedence:</p>
<table class="info">
  <tr id="LoopFileName">
    <td>A_LoopFileName</td>
    <td>The name of the file or folder currently retrieved (without the path).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr id="LoopFileExt">
    <td>A_LoopFileExt</td>
    <td>The file's extension (e.g. TXT, DOC, or EXE). The period (.) is not included.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr id="LoopFilePath">
    <td>A_LoopFilePath</td>
    <td>The path and name of the file/folder currently retrieved. If <em>FilePattern</em> contains a relative path rather than an absolute path, the path here will also be relative. In addition, any short (8.3) folder names in <em>FilePattern</em> will still be short (see next item to get the long version).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr id="LoopFileFullPath">
    <td>A_LoopFileFullPath</td>
    <td>This is different than A_LoopFilePath in the following ways: 1) It always contains the absolute/complete path of the file even if <em>FilePattern</em> contains a relative path; 2) Any short (8.3) folder names in <em>FilePattern</em> itself are converted to their long names; 3) Characters in <em>FilePattern</em> are converted to uppercase or lowercase to match the case stored in the file system. This is useful for converting file names -- such as those passed into a script as command line parameters -- to their exact path names as shown by Explorer.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr id="LoopFileShortPath">
    <td>A_LoopFileShortPath</td>
    <td><p>The 8.3 short path and name of the file/folder currently retrieved. For example: C:\MYDOCU~1\ADDRES~1.txt. If <em>FilePattern</em> contains a relative path rather than an absolute path, the path here will also be relative.</p>
      <p>To retrieve the complete 8.3 path and name for a single file or folder, specify its name for <em>FilePattern</em> as in this example:</p>
<pre>Loop, Files, C:\My Documents\Address List.txt
    ShortPathName := A_LoopFileShortPath</pre>
        <p>NOTE: This variable will be <strong>blank</strong> if the file does not have a short name, which can happen on systems where NtfsDisable8dot3NameCreation has been set in the registry. It will also be blank if FilePattern contains a relative path and the body of the loop uses <a href="SetWorkingDir.htm">SetWorkingDir</a> to switch away from the working directory in effect for the loop itself.</p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr id="LoopFileShortName">
    <td>A_LoopFileShortName</td>
    <td>The 8.3 short name, or alternate name of the file. If the file doesn't have one (due to the long name being shorter than 8.3 or perhaps because short-name generation is disabled on an NTFS file system), <em>A_LoopFileName</em> will be retrieved instead.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr id="LoopFileDir">
    <td>A_LoopFileDir</td>
    <td>The path of the directory in which <em>A_LoopFileName</em> resides. If <em>FilePattern</em> contains a relative path rather than an absolute path, the path here will also be relative. A root directory will not contain a trailing backslash. For example: C:</td>
  </tr>
  <tr id="LoopFileTimeModified">
    <td>A_LoopFileTimeModified</td>
    <td>The time the file was last modified. Format <a href="FileSetTime.htm">YYYYMMDDHH24MISS</a>.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr id="LoopFileTimeCreated">
    <td>A_LoopFileTimeCreated</td>
    <td>The time the file was created. Format <a href="FileSetTime.htm">YYYYMMDDHH24MISS</a>.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr id="LoopFileTimeAccessed">
    <td>A_LoopFileTimeAccessed</td>
    <td>The time the file was last accessed. Format <a href="FileSetTime.htm">YYYYMMDDHH24MISS</a>.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr id="LoopFileAttrib">
    <td>A_LoopFileAttrib</td>
    <td>The <a href="FileGetAttrib.htm">attributes</a> of the file currently retrieved.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr id="LoopFileSize">
    <td>A_LoopFileSize</td>
    <td>The size in bytes of the file currently retrieved. Files larger than 4 gigabytes are also supported.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr id="LoopFileSizeKB">
    <td>A_LoopFileSizeKB</td>
    <td>The size in Kbytes of the file currently retrieved, rounded down to the nearest integer.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr id="LoopFileSizeMB">
    <td>A_LoopFileSizeMB</td>
    <td>The size in Mbytes of the file currently retrieved, rounded down to the nearest integer.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<h3>Remarks</h3>
<p>A file-loop is useful when you want to operate on a collection of files and/or folders, one at a time.</p>
<p>All matching files are retrieved, including hidden files. By contrast, OS features such as the DIR command omit hidden files by default. To avoid processing hidden, system, and/or read-only files, use something like the following inside the loop:</p>
<pre>if A_LoopFileAttrib contains H,R,S  <em>; Skip any file that is either H (Hidden), R (Read-only), or S (System). Note: No spaces in &quot;H,R,S&quot;.</em>
    continue  <em>; Skip this file and move on to the next one.</em></pre>
<p>To retrieve files' relative paths instead of absolute paths during a recursive search, use <a href="SetWorkingDir.htm">SetWorkingDir</a> to change to the base folder prior to the loop, and then omit the path from the Loop (e.g. <code>Loop, Files, *.*, R</code>). That will cause <a href="#LoopFilePath">A_LoopFilePath</a> to contain the file's path relative to the base folder.</p>
<p>A file-loop can disrupt itself if it creates or renames files or folders within its own purview. For example, if it renames files via <a href="FileMove.htm">FileMove</a> or other means, each such file might be found twice: once as its old name and again as its new name. To work around this, rename the files only after creating a list of them. For example:</p>
<pre>FileList := &quot;&quot;
Loop, Files, *.jpg
   FileList .= A_LoopFileName &quot;`n&quot;
Loop, Parse, %FileList%, `n
   FileMove, %A_LoopField%, renamed_%A_LoopField%</pre>
<p>Files in an NTFS file system are probably always retrieved in alphabetical order. Files in other file systems are retrieved in no particular order. To ensure a particular ordering, use the <a href="Sort.htm">Sort</a> command as shown in the Examples section below.</p>
<p>Files and folders with a complete path name longer than 259 characters are skipped over as though they do not exist. Such files are rare because normally, the operating system does not allow their creation.</p>
<p>See <a href="Loop.htm">Loop</a> for information about <a href="Block.htm">Blocks</a>, <a href="Break.htm">Break</a>, <a href="Continue.htm">Continue</a>, and the A_Index variable (which exists in every type of loop).</p>
