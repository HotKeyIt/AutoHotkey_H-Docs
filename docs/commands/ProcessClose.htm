<h1>ProcessClose</h1>

<p>Closes a process.</p>

<pre class="Syntax"><b>OutputVar</b> := <span class="func">ProcessClose</span>(PID-or-Name)
<pre><em>Command  Example:</em> ProcessClose "Notepad.exe"
<em>Function Example:</em> <b>PID</b> := ProcessClose("Notepad.exe")</pre></pre>

<dl>
  <dt><b>OutputVar</b></dt>
    <dd><p>The name of the variable in which to store the PID of closed process or 0 / false otherwise (there was no matching process or there was a problem terminating it).</p>
    </dd>
  <dt>PID-or-Name</dt>
  <dd><p>This parameter can be either a number (the PID) or a process name as described below. It can also be left blank to get PID of the script itself.</p>
      <p>PID: The Process ID, which is a number that uniquely identifies one specific process (this number is valid only during the lifetime of that process). The PID of a newly launched process can be determined via the <a href="Run.htm">Run</a> command. Similarly, the PID of a window can be determined with <a href="WinGet.htm">WinGet</a>.</p>
      <p>Name: The name of a process is usually the same as its executable (without path), e.g. notepad.exe or winword.exe. Since a name might match multiple running processes, only the first process will be reported. The name is not case sensitive.</p></dd>
</dl>

<h3>Remarks</h3>
<p>Since the process will be abruptly terminated -- possibly interrupting its work at a critical point or resulting in the loss of unsaved data in its windows (if it has any) -- this method should be used only if a process cannot be closed by using <a href="WinClose.htm">WinClose</a> on one of its windows.</p>
