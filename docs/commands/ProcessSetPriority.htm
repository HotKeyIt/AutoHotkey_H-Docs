<h1>ProcessSetPriority</h1>

<p>Changes the priority (as seen in Windows Task Manager) of a process.</p>

<pre class="Syntax">ProcessSetPriority, Priority, PID-or-Name
<pre><em>Command  Example:</em> ProcessSetPriority, High, Notepad.exe, 
<em>Function Example:</em> <b>PID</b> := ProcessSetPriority("High","Notepad.exe")</pre></pre>

<dl>
  <dt><b>OutputVar</b></dt>
    <dd><p>The name of the variable in which to store the PID of process which priority was changed or 0 / false otherwise (there was no matching process or there was a problem setting priority).</p>
    </dd>
  <dt>PID-or-Name</dt>
  <dd><p>This parameter can be either a number (the PID) or a process name as described below. It can also be left blank to get PID of the script itself.</p>
      <p>PID: The Process ID, which is a number that uniquely identifies one specific process (this number is valid only during the lifetime of that process). The PID of a newly launched process can be determined via the <a href="Run.htm">Run</a> command. Similarly, the PID of a window can be determined with <a href="WinGet.htm">WinGet</a>.</p>
      <p>Name: The name of a process is usually the same as its executable (without path), e.g. notepad.exe or winword.exe. Since a name might match multiple running processes, only the first process will be reported. The name is not case sensitive.</p></dd>
  
  <dt>Priority</dt>
  <dd><p>Process priority: L (or Low), B (or BelowNormal), N (or Normal), A (or AboveNormal), H (or High), R (or Realtime).</p></dd>
</dl>

<h3>Remarks</h3>
<p>Note: Any process not designed to run at Realtime priority might reduce system stability if set to that level.</p>
