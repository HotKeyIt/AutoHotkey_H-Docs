; Easy Window Dragging (requires XP/2k/NT)
; http://www.autohotkey.com
; Normally, a window can only be dragged by clicking on its title bar.
; This script extends that so that any point inside a window can be dragged.
; To activate this mode, hold down CapsLock or the middle mouse button while
; clicking, then drag the window to a new position.

; Note: You can optionally release Capslock or the middle mouse button after
; pressing down the mouse button rather than holding it down the whole time.

~MButton & LButton::
CapsLock & LButton::
CoordMode, Mouse  ; Switch to screen/absolute coordinates.
MouseGetPos, EWD_MouseStartX, EWD_MouseStartY, EWD_MouseWin
WinGetPos, EWD_OriginalPosX, EWD_OriginalPosY,,, ahk_id %EWD_MouseWin%
WinGetMinMax, EWD_WinState, ahk_id %EWD_MouseWin% 
if !EWD_WinState  ; Only if the window isn't maximized 
	SetTimer, EWD_WatchMouse, 10 ; Track the mouse as the user drags it.
return

EWD_WatchMouse:
GetKeyState, EWD_LButtonState, LButton, P
if !EWD_LButtonState  ; Button has been released, so drag is complete.
{
	SetTimer,, off
	return
}
GetKeyState, EWD_EscapeState, Escape, P
if EWD_EscapeState  ; Escape has been pressed, so drag is cancelled.
{
	SetTimer,, off
	WinMove, ahk_id %EWD_MouseWin%,, %EWD_OriginalPosX%, %EWD_OriginalPosY%
	return
}
; Otherwise, reposition the window to match the change in mouse coordinates
; caused by the user having dragged the mouse:
CoordMode, Mouse
MouseGetPos, EWD_MouseX, EWD_MouseY
WinGetPos, EWD_WinX, EWD_WinY,,, ahk_id %EWD_MouseWin%
SetWinDelay, -1   ; Makes the below move faster/smoother.
WinMove, ahk_id %EWD_MouseWin%,, % EWD_WinX + EWD_MouseX - EWD_MouseStartX, % EWD_WinY + EWD_MouseY - EWD_MouseStartY
EWD_MouseStartX := EWD_MouseX  ; Update for the next timer-call to this subroutine.
EWD_MouseStartY := EWD_MouseY
return
